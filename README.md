## v0.2 rc1 notes
### github commit notes
 added footer, navbar, github link, gradient. fixed typing animation.s

 added mobile responsiveness (limited, only fixing height issues with typing with different screen aspect ratios)

NOTE: committing this will permanently put this work in CC BY SA.

This is a first draft. Add full mobile responsiveness and more content before merging pull request
### known issues
- mobile responsiveness
- height issues regarding first panel alignment
- navbar isn't opaque
- you sometimes can't scroll back up from `"What does SPECS stand for?"`
### updates needed
- cards are really hard to add more then one line to. Maybe a rework is needed
- there isn't any content lol
- navbar might want to have different pages to nav to besides home and github page
- maybe a section about the markers of the website? something to consider
